# CSV Parser  :page_facing_up: :pencil2:
  Swift module for ease parsing CSV text into Swift data structures. :bookmark_tabs:
  
  I created this module for my part-time (internship) and eventually I realised this might be useful for iOS programmers who often work with CSV. 
  Hence I uploaded this module and hope it helps. Any open issue and improvements are welcomed for this little project.  
  Powered by sheer Swift 4


## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

- Xcode 9.2+
- Swift 4+

## SETUP
:fax: Just copy the swift code (the entire CSV class from swift module). You can add the extension but it's not relevant at all currently.

## Acknowledgement 

- Thanks to google and stack overflow for helping me in debugging and stuffs...
